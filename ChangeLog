20050207 ka0ttic (Release)
    * Added _pkgname_only() to complete only on package names (no categories).
    Both emerge -C and equery can now take advantage of this and do not only
    complete on cat/pkg.
    * Updated gcc-config completion to actually complete on the compiler (eg.
    i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.0.0).
    * Added webapp-config completion.
    * Added portageq completion.
    * Added short command support for equery, so that something like "equery b
    <TAB>" would be treated as 'equery belongs <TAB>'.
