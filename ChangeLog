	* Complete on packages in PORTDIR_OVERYLAY in addition to PORTDIR.

	* Tag 20050207 release.
	* Added _pkgname_only() to complete only on package names (no
	categories).  Both emerge -C and equery can now take advantage of
	this and do not only complete on cat/pkg.
	* Updated gcc-config completion to actually complete on the compiler
	(eg. i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.0.0).
	* Added webapp-config completion.
	* Added portageq completion.
	* Added short command support for equery, so that something like
	'equery b <TAB>' would be treated as 'equery belongs <TAB>'.
