2005-04-28 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Fixed portageq completion to use env -i when parsing emerge -v
	--info output for envvar completion.

	* Added euse completion.

2005-04-19 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	make.{conf,globals} is unreadable.

2005-04-18 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Added revdep-rebuild completion.
	* Fixed etcat -v completion (was only completing on installed
	packages).

2005-04-17 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Tagged 20050417 Release.
	* Fixed bug (#88797) that caused any package name matching "*-h*" to
	be interpreted as -h|--help.
	* Fixed bug (#88799) that caused -Ca (or any other option after -C) to
	not complete properly on only installed packages.
	* Fixed bug (#88152) that caused lack of filename completion after any
	kind of redirect (> or <).
	* Fixed bug in conditional completion if the condition wasn't quoted
	and the package being completed also has an ebuild in one of the
	overlays.

2005-04-12 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Added etcat completion.

2005-04-09 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Added have() so that it's possible for users to install the
	completions "locally".

2005-03-29 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Tagged 20050329 release.
	* Added metadata.xml to the list of excludes when completing on
	category/package, so that _emerge won't complete on
	'category/metadata.xml'.
	* Fixed cases where quoting and a condition (">= fex) failed to
	complete properly.
	* Converted all extended regular expressions to bash extglobs in
	_emerge.  ***NO*** external calls exist anymore :)

2005-03-22 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Update _ebuild commands.

2005-03-16 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Tag 20050316 release.
	* Fixed bug where conditionals like "=cat/pkg-ver" (with quotes)
	would erase the conditional (=) when completing.  Thanks to mcummings
	for making me aware of this.
	* Fixed bug where version completion was only completing on things in
	PORTDIR and not PORTDIR_OVERYLAY.

2005-03-14 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Complete on packages in PORTDIR_OVERYLAY in addition to PORTDIR.

2005-02-07 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Tag 20050207 release.
	* Added _pkgname_only() to complete only on package names (no
	categories).  Both emerge -C and equery can now take advantage of
	this and do not only complete on cat/pkg.
	* Updated gcc-config completion to actually complete on the compiler
	(eg. i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.0.0).
	* Added webapp-config completion.
	* Added portageq completion.
	* Added short command support for equery, so that something like
	'equery b <TAB>' would be treated as 'equery belongs <TAB>'.
