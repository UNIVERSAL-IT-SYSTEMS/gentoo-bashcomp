	* Removed all occurrences of $grepcmd and $sedcmd from _emerge.
	* Added metadata.xml to the list of excludes when completing on
	category/package, so that _emerge won't complete on
	'category/metadata.xml'.
	* Fixed cases where quoting and a condition (">= fex) failed to
	complete properly.
	* Converted all extended regular expressions to bash extglobs in
	_emerge.  ***NO*** external calls exist anymore :)

	* Update _ebuild commands.

2005-03-16 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Tag 20050316 release.
	* Fixed bug where conditionals like "=cat/pkg-ver" (with quotes)
	would erase the conditional (=) when completing.  Thanks to mcummings
	for making me aware of this.
	* Fixed bug where version completion was only completing on things in
	PORTDIR and not PORTDIR_OVERYLAY.

2005-03-14 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Complete on packages in PORTDIR_OVERYLAY in addition to PORTDIR.

2005-02-07 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Tag 20050207 release.
	* Added _pkgname_only() to complete only on package names (no
	categories).  Both emerge -C and equery can now take advantage of
	this and do not only complete on cat/pkg.
	* Updated gcc-config completion to actually complete on the compiler
	(eg. i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.0.0).
	* Added webapp-config completion.
	* Added portageq completion.
	* Added short command support for equery, so that something like
	'equery b <TAB>' would be treated as 'equery belongs <TAB>'.
